<div><span style="color: #000000;">The kidneys are two fist sized organs located in the abdomen toward the back, normally one on each side of the spine. The main function of the kidneys is to remove waste products and excess water from the blood. The kidneys process about 200 liters of blood every day to produce about two to three liters of urine. The kidneys also produce certain hormones that have important functions in the body like vitamin D, erythropoietin (EPO) and renin. With the loss of kidney function, there is an accumulation of waste and toxic substances in the body, that are normally excreted by the kidney.</span><br><span style="color: #000000;">Loss of kidney function also causes other problems such as anemia, high blood pressure, metabolic acidosis, disorders of cholesterol and bone disease. Kidney Injury may be acute or chronic.</span><br><span style="color: #000000;">Acute kidney injury. It develops rapidly, over days or weeks and usually develops in response to a disorder that directly affects the kidney, its blood supply, or urine flow from it. Acute kidney injury is often reversible, with complete recovery of kidney function although it may progress to chronic kidney disease.</span></div>					</div>

				<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Department of General Medicine delivers expert medical services in diverse specialties from cardiology, nephrology, and oncology to managing symptoms, performing routine and specialized evaluative procedures and comprehensively managing patient requirements. It is the medical specialty that deals with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of adult diseases. The physicians are skilled in the management of patients who have undifferentiated or multi-system disease processes. General practitioners do not specialize in one particular area of medicine and provide routine health care (e.g., physical examinations, immunizations) and assess and treat many different conditions, including illnesses and injuries. General medicine covers the vast majority of hospital-based specialties. It is comprised of the prevention, diagnosis, and management of a wide range of diseases and hospital-based interventional procedures. These include, but are not limited to cardiology, dermatology, immunology, neurology, and tropical medicine. Continental is one of the best hospitals in Hyderabad for General Medicine practice.</span></p>
